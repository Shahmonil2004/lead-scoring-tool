Lead Scoring Tool: AI-Driven Lead Scoring Model
Approach:

The project was aimed at creating a real-time lead scoring tool using machine learning, designed to predict the potential of leads converting into customers. The tool takes user input via a Streamlit UI, where sales teams or marketers can enter lead details. The tool predicts a lead score based on user inputs such as engagement score, website visits, time spent on the website, lead stage, and lead type.
Model Selection:

For this task, I utilized the Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning technique known for its robustness against overfitting, ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, and its high accuracy in predicting continuous values. The Random Forest model is well-suited for lead scoring tasks as it can handle complex relationships in the data and provide insight into feature importance.
Data Preprocessing:

Key preprocessing steps included:

    Feature Engineering: Categorical variables (like "Lead Stage" and "Lead Type") were converted into numerical values via label encoding.

    Handling Missing Values: Missing or incomplete data was filled with default values to ensure no data rows were excluded from the model.

    Feature Alignment: The order of features was matched with the modelâ€™s input during training to ensure consistency.

The following features were used for predictions:

    Engagement Score

    Total Visits

    Page Views per Visit

    Average Time per Visit

    Lead Stage

    Lead Type

Performance Evaluation:

The model performed well, with relatively low error rates, allowing for accurate prediction of lead scores. The accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) were used to evaluate the model. The next steps involve fine-tuning the model for even better performance, especially with additional features and hyperparameter optimization.
Future Improvements (If Backend Access Is Available):

    Real-Time Data Integration: Integrating real-time user data from the website (e.g., page visits, user actions) would help make dynamic lead scoring and provide up-to-the-minute predictions.

    Automated Data Collection: By automating the process of tracking lead behavior directly through the website, we could eliminate the need for manual data entry and ensure that all lead data is up-to-date.

    Continuous Model Training: Retraining the model periodically with new lead conversion data would ensure the model evolves with trends and improves its accuracy over time.

    External Data Enrichment: Integrating external data sources (e.g., social media, industry-specific information) could provide richer features, improving lead scoring accuracy, especially when user input is minimal.

    Model Optimization: Implementing hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV would optimize the model's performance and enhance prediction accuracy.

Conclusion:

This lead scoring tool allows businesses to prioritize leads efficiently by predicting their conversion potential. With backend access, additional features like real-time data integration, automated updates, and continuous model training could further optimize the tool's effectiveness. These improvements would lead to a more adaptive system that aligns with evolving business needs.
